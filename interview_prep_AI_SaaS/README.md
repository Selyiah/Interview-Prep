What is your understanding of who TheyDo is? 

"From what I understand, TheyDo helps large companies get a clearer picture of their customer journeys. So instead of different teams working in silos, it brings everything into
one structured place, so they can actually see where customers are struggling and decide what to prioritise. And I think the interesting part is that it connects those journeys to 
real business outcomes, not just visual maps."

- My understanding is that it's a platform that helps companies manage and optimise customer journeys in a more structured way, especially at enterprise scale.


Why TheyDo specifically? What stood out to you about us?

"What stood out to me is that you're not just creating visual journeys maps, you're helping enterprises actually prioritise and opertionalise customer experience. From what I 
understand, the platform brings together different teams and data into one structured system, so companies can clearly see where customers are struggling and tie that back to 
measurable outcomes. I'm really interested in that intersection between customer insight and real business impact, especially enterprise scale. That feels like a meaningful space to
build in."




So tell me about your experience?

- So I'm currently working as a data engineer in a production environment where I own pipelines end-to-end. From pulling data from external systems through to transforming it
and making sure stakeholders can rely on it.

- A big part of my role is taking quite messy or unclear business requirements and turning them into structured datasets. I spend a lot of time thinking about modelling properly
so things are scalable and easy to maintain.

- And I'd say the other thing I focus on a lot is reliability. I've worked on reducing operational issues by seperating concerns in pipelines, adding monitoring, and making sure
failures don't create big downstream problems.


what's motivating you to explore new opportunities at this stage in your career? 

"I've learned a lot in my current role around building reliable production systems and owning pipelines end-to-end. At this stage, I'm looking for something with more 
architecural ownership and impact, ideally in a SaaS environment. I'm particularly interesting in working closer to product, where the data layer directly supports 
decision-making and feature development. That kind of end-to-end ownership and product proximity is something I'm really motivated by."



We're a fully remote, async team with a lot of autonomy. How do you work in environments where there isn't a lot of structure or ticket assignment? 

"My first role at GoPuff was fully remote, so I'm comfortable working async and managing my own priorities. In environments with high autonomy, I make sure I'm clear on outcomes and
impact rather than just tasks. I tend to structure my own work based on what will unblock others or move the needle most, and I communicate proactively so there's visibility even
without constant meetings. I actually enjoy that level of ownership, it pushes me to think more strategically about what I'm building."



What would success look like for you in your first six months here? 

By six months, I'd expect to have taken full ownership of at least one meaningful initiative and delivered measurable impact from it. I'd want to be fully comfortable with the data
platform and ecosystem, and understand how it connects to product and business priorities. I'd also aim to have built strong working relationships across product and engineerings so
I can proactively identify opportunities rather than react to requests. For me, success would mean I'm trusted to shape decisions, not just execute tasks.
